# Mobile-App-RS-Platform

Business aims to make a difference in the market. In order reach out to the right customers, companies need to be exposed to them at first. 
The recommender system is built to narrow down this gap. After searching key words, such as interested mobile app names or persona names, 
users who are from business side would be able find out related mobile apps that are highly correlated with targeted customers.

For example, companies who run pet food business might want to know where (competitors) that customers choose. Through searching key words such as 'puppy food',
'cat', or certain pet food brand names, users would be able to find out competitors (mobile apps) where customers also like to visit online. 

Due to data source confidentiality, I am not be able to share all raw data files in on a public platform.  


Special thanks to https://github.com/chengstone/movie_recommender , which helps me to think and design more logically.
